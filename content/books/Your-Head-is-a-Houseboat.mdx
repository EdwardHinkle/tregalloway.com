# 🤔Impressions

## From the style of art to quirkiness of messaging I can tell if very in line with Struthless vibe from his videos. I also feel like this style of book is very accessible for people across all ages.

# 🏃🏾💨Actionable Takeaways

1. 🖋**Grab a journal, write down ALL your thoughts or record them.** Don't stop when you're tired stop when you're down. No format required!
2. 🧘🏾‍♂️**Go Quiet and Reflect.** Turning off external stimuli for at least 10 mins a day either meditating or just sitting doing nothing. When unwanted thoughts fill your head grab your journal or voice recorder and examine them 1. When did they get in your head (the moment)? 2. What did you make this moment mean (the subjective interpretation)? 3. What actually happened (the objective truth)? 4. Where has this feeling shown up in your life since the pattern)? 5. What would your head look like if they left (the potential)? 6. Do you believe it's possible to live without them in your head (the possibility)?

>     **THIS HELPS TO** reduce the power that other people's opinions have on you (so you can ultimately hear your own opinions)

3. 🤔**Wants Comparison.** Write down everything you wanted out of life 5 years ago. The goal is to show you how your wants change over time. Now write down everything you know, this is us practicing to checking in with our desires.
4. **Questions from the bosses.** Grab your wants list and ask:
    1. What does Selma the Sensible want to do?
    2. What does Luka the Liver want to do?
    3. What does Freya the Friendly want to do?
    4. What does Aziz the Ambitious want to do?
    5. What does Gilda the Giver want to do?
    6. What voice matters the most?

>     **THIS HELPS TO**  understand that there is no such thing as a perfect path (but there are paths that require less internal compromise)

5. 📉**Disempower your Inner Criticism.** Think about the last time you were mean to yourself and write it out in 1 or 2 sentences.
    1. Think about when it first came up
    2. Think about when it pops up
    3. Think about how to live with it
    4. Then think how to show it love
6. **Focus on your opinions.** When it comes to your opinions consider the following:
    1. What would be the truth if you were wrong?
    2. What would it mean if you were wrong?
    3. How have your cognitive biases shaped this opinion?
    4. If you had zero cognitive biases, what might you believe instead?
    5. Which do you believe is closer to the truth?
    6. How can these varying beliefs serve you?

>     **THIS HELPS TO**  see the world beyond our cognitive biases and distortions.

7. 🤯**Remember you can't outthink Biology.**
    - Make sure you aren't tired, hungry or thirsty. Your physiological needs should be met before starting this exercise. This is so we don't wrongly attribute our hunger to angst or our sleepiness to a lack of passion.
    - Think of the last moment when you felt a more animalistic side of you take over and describe it in a sentence or two. Think: raw emotions. Maybe you found yourself cut off in traffic and responded with sixty seconds of horn-holding while you recited all the devil's words you know. Maybe you read the news and thought the world was going to end. Maybe you just got hangry. Who knows.
    - Instead of judging yourself, reframe the action as an identifying quirk of our species. Re-write that sentence from the last step as something that all humans do, and add 'and I love that'. For example, instead of saying, 'I got really heartbroken when my boss told me to work over the weekend" perhaps you'd say, 'Humans get really heartbroken when their bosses tell them to work over the weekend .. and I love that'
    - This should firstly help ease any shame, guilt or confusion you might have had in your reaction - it's a hallmark of our species and you're not alone in your feelings!
    - Secondly your brain is designed to solve problems, and it'l start trying to solve the problem of why you love that. For our working-over-the-weekend example, you might love it because it makes you appreciate the value of the time you do get to yourself.

> **THIS HELPS TO** respect the fact that we are imperfect animals with biological trademarks, functions and quirks (that we can learn to love).

8. 🙇🏾‍♂️**Be compassionate to yourself as if you were a child.** Every time you think of something negative about yourself think " would I say this to the child version of myself". Most of the time the answer is no, so show yourself some love.
